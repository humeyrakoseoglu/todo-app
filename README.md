# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## About the project
- In this simple to-do application, the expression we get from the input is added to the todo list.
- When the checkbox at the beginning of a to-do element in the list is clicked, it becomes visible with a strikethrough. If you have completed the task, you can press this button.
- To the right of each element in the list there is an "X" button to delete the corresponding todo. You can use this if you want to delete one by one.
- You can filter with the "All", "Active" and "Completed" buttons.
- With "Clear completed" you can sing all completed todos at once.
